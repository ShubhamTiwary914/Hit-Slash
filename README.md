<h4> Making Changes </h4>



> Use either github desktop, or git
> 1. First "clone" the repo - download from here to your local storage <br>
> 2. Make any changes you want, then commit(save changes)- in github desktop  [additionally use 'add' for git cli] <br>
> 3. Push to upload, but before that 'pull' to fetch changes just in case there are any, so theres no issues <br>
> 4. Finally push and check if its correctly gone up.
